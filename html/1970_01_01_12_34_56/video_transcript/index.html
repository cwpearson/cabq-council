        <p>the opportunity to talk to you a little bit about the West Side Emergency Housing Center and our capital improvement strategic plan. I thought we would start off a little bit by kind of introducing and talking about upgrades that have already kind of been done out there. So starting back in 2019, I came on board around 2018. We did identify that the clinic and behavioral health space area needed to be redone. You'll notice there are some pictures there in regards to the clinic area if you've been out there as well as some of our behavioral health case management area. More recently, we've updated our warming kitchen. So you'll see some photos in there that</p>

And then, of course, you see some dryers there. They're both for kind of mitigating and looking at how we deal with bed bugs and infestation with the facility because it's quite challenging to remove them once they're there. But the goal today is really to look at what the facility has and the needs that we want to address. On the left, you're going to go ahead and see a pod that we began renovations and putting cots.

We also understand that, you know, basically within the time that we came on, we went from a six-month shelter with only evening winter usage to 24 operations year-round, which has created a lot of use of the facility. The facilities do indeed need rest and repair and maintenance. We offer a lot of free shuttle services out there to the community that we serve, and of course, we do have limited kind of medical services there that do cease right around 9 p.m. It's nothing intense, but we're continuing to see a higher and higher need of medical needs from clients who are being discharged to our facility, which is probably not the most ideal, but there are no other options in our</p>

We continue to see high levels of medical need and acuity for individuals who are being discharged and, of course, the needs that they're having. So with that, we want to make sure that you are aware of our strategic plan and the funding analysis that we've done to be able to secure that. Interior renovations is a big priority of ours. You'll see that we have 12 dormitories. These dormitories are all in need of various different levels of repair. We've already began some.

It's mostly dirt terrain that doesn't allow for accessibility with walkers, wheelchairs and or other devices. We'd like to be able to do a fire, an increased pathway that goes around it, also improve that road area. We're also looking at an area of space in which we would like to include that had covered storage for individuals who have items that are actually being held in the facility, but also can get in the way of either they're blocking the hallways or access ways and we have no other place to put that storage.

Again, 18 miles outside of town. The only thing next to that is going to be that composting area for the city, the water authority and then the fire, the shooting range is a little further up the road. So this is our property area and the outer area, some of the areas that also is included in this plan to be able to address with the capital. The breakdown of the fees were basically in there.

So I wanted to make sure that you all had a clear picture of our thinking. We've been addressing it. We've had several assessments done. This was the most fair one that we could put together in regards to breaking this information down so as you all are making decisions and looking at what the investments are, to know exactly where we would put those investments and how we would upgrade this facility to continue to be a safe place for those who are unhoused.

I could track down where that funding specifically went for those upgrades. But I can get that to you.</p>

        <p>Council President, Councilor. Yes, we've talked about our medical respite program coming online at the gateway with regards to those 50 beds and how crucial they'll be to the continuum of care for individuals. It's gonna be a much better pathway for individuals who are being exited from hospitals who need long-term care and or recovery time periods, 45 days to 90 days of healing in an environment in which their medical providers can actually oversee them. So that's currently under construction at the gateway facility, which will be a huge value add because right now what we are seeing is a huge push for those who are being discharged from medical facilities who are unhoused into our shelter facility, which is not the most appropriate place for healing and or care. We don't have that staff to do it. So the long-term way we wish to address this is the investment in the gateway respite areas and those beds, which is being constructed.</p>

        <p>Thank you, Chief Medina for coming out here. This is in regards to a letter I received from the ABQ Corps Downtown Neighborhood Association. And this is for them a request for consistent support for downtown residents and businesses. Just to throw a quick at what's written in here without reading the entire thing, our residents are dependent upon our local resources such as grocery stores, residential units, small businesses, tourists, income traffic, and so and they're asking for the city to enforce their existing laws including criminal trespass on post, most of private properties, traffic laws, noise ordinance, vandalism laws, and criminal laws in general. And I believe the genesis of this to a large degree</p>

We've got a growing food desert throughout parts of our city and here in downtown they're fortunate to have a small grocery store, independent grocery store. And of course all the issues that go along with that here downtown. And I also understand that there is a misconception or perception when we look at downtown when we think of the entryways or the alcoves and all the buildings, they are perceived as public spaces. And the reality is those are actually private property. And so some questions from me and for them. Can officers proactively address trespassing on private property in the city?</p>

        <p>and President Lewis, Councilor Baca. Yes, we could easily do that. Deputy Commander Jose Sanchez has been assigned to downtown. And as you know, when the mayor's administration came in 2018, we did establish a downtown public safety district. And the whole goal of the public safety district was to keep the same officers working downtown as long as possible so that they would know the area. They do know the areas. They know a lot of the places where they can and cannot site. They do work also with ACS with some circumstances. And I could definitely talk to a commander, make sure he goes by and that they're doing their rounds at the Silver Street. I know they do a lot of work there from the past. I've spoken to them about it. And I'll make sure they continue to stay in communication with the business owner.</p>

        <p>and President Lewis, thank you for being here, allowing me to be here this evening to give an update of what I'm able to give an update. I did receive your questions and we did provide a response. And I think the biggest thing to remember is I still am bound to a federal investigation. I do have a letter from the U.S. Attorney that I think there's two key points in there to look at. Number one, the U.S. Attorney is reminding us that they control the release of information in these cases and that we have to work with them. And number two, the U.S. Attorney clearly puts that thanks Chief Medina has been, thank you for working with us closely and thank you for everything you've done in house support this investigation. With that said, I know that a majority of the questions revolved around missed court and we provided answers. We gave the SOPs to those sections. There is currently an argument within the public safety center, public safety areas. I know the district</p>

        <p>attorney, I'm not going to hide from it. He just said that they've never been responsible and it's not their responsibility to give us missed court notices. I think that both, we have two city councilors that were former police officers and every officer knows that over the past 20 years we've received missed court notices from the courts. I mean from the district attorney's office in DWI FTAs. If that's changed, unfortunately, I can't find documentation for that's changed and we can address that. But the rest of the questions are answered in the letter. We're actually at an all time low in missed courts. Cases being dismissed for missed court. I think you saw, I think the letter says 3% are actually missed so there's been great improvement. But other than that, I think if there's any specific questions you have towards all those pages of documents and the path that we've traveled to get to the point where we have the successively low number of cases being dismissed for FDA, I will try to answer them.</p>

        <p>President Lewis, Councilor Sanchez, I was just trying to make sure that we were aware of the fact that this could be bigger because I think it's very important for us to understand. Missed court notices for generations since I came on the department used to always were mailed to APD and they've always come through either the district attorney's office, motor vehicle. In some incidents, traffic violations come through the courts and sometimes we even get them from district courts in terms of felony cases that may have been missed. When these cases, when these notices are received by the Albuquerque Police Department prior to 2019, they were investigated by their supervisors. Their supervisors would investigate these cases. These cases would be investigated by their supervisors in 2019 as part of our settlement agreement, all these cases started to go would be filtered through our entry into a pro where they would generate a record showing that that officer had missed court. So the process may be a little different with who gets them, but they're still investigated. But the trigger point comes back to who has notified us that an officer has missed court. It is very easy to talk about the fact that we could look it up in new Mexico courts com and I'm more than happy to start doing that. I will come back to counsel. I'll ask for approximately 20 full time positions for us to be able to do this because we've never had the staffing to look up every single case in New Mexico. We talked about where we're going to go and what we're trying to accomplish.</p>

I don't know the inner workings. I just knew my sergeant told me, hey, you miss court. So to understand the complete process, those entities would advise you, APD, that Dan Champine miss court.

        <p>President Lewis, Councilor Champlain, you're absolutely correct. Historically, that's how it's always been done. This is nothing that I've changed and implemented as the chief of police for the Albuquerque Police Department. This is something that goes back historically for years. The trigger point was somebody notifying us that somebody had missed court. And it just didn't happen recently. I think the most important thing, I mean, there's two key points here is in September of 2022 we've learned that the court notices stopped coming from the district attorney's office. We are conducting an investigation into that. I will not comment any further on that. But we're trying to see what occurred after September of 2022. What I do know is when this went public three weeks ago from year to date from now to this point, all of a sudden the system's working again. And although the DA's office is not responsible for telling this officer's missed court, they've sent us 33 notices this month already. That are all being investigated.</p>

        <p>Council President Louis Stahr, Councilor Champagne, I think that the big thing that's happened with the settlement agreement in DOJ coming in that's changed since a lot of the people here have been a member of the Albuquerque Police Department is prior we had hang files. That was one of the issues that we had under leading into DOJ is that at the end of every bit of hang file either went to the new Sergeant or it stayed with the old Sergeant and there was no means to track history to see if officers were missing stuff. That is why in 2019 to start catching this in their DOJ recommended that we start having an IA Pro entry. So no matter who the supervisor is, who's the past supervisor, the present supervisor, the future supervisor going to be, they would have access to all those missed court notices in IA Pro and that's something that Superintendent Garcia could explain into more depth if you need.</p>

From there, we go to my major, Jimmy Collins, for final disposition of that case. Now, if it's subsequent, if it's over, if it's two or more, more than likely that's going to be sent to Internal Affairs Professional Standards to investigate. When they're done with their investigation, then it'll go to the professional integrity commanders for review and major Collins as well. If it's four or above, it's a suspension, then I review the case. I conduct a predetermination hearing.</p>

The field supervisors overseeing them, they're still doing DWIs. I still got an update last week about the number of DWIs they have and I have the number at the top of my head. So they're still working it. A lot of the roadblocks were always conducted off of a grant for overtime and I think when the time comes and we could talk about some of the changes that the leadership and DWI made over the past two years were really key in helping us identify some things that were occurring and they really reduced the amount of overtime and would limit the amount of court unknowingly. They didn't know this was going on. So the unit is still functional. It's assigned to field squads and they're still responding and they utilize a grant overtime to supplement for roadblocks.</p>

Based on my experience, all they needed to do, and the reason why we hear about this now is because there was some indictments, I mean not indictments, there was some executed search warrants and since those executed search warrants came out, those are probably just to finish off the icing on the cake.

So right now, as you all know, we're, I'm not going to talk about this case, but litigation regarding the Air Board, regarding the two bills that the council passed as law. Super majority of the council that passed and created laws regarding our ordinances and our ability to be able to create ordinances and change our ordinances and our attorneys are fighting hard in court over that.

Their very existence here in the city of Albuquerque, as well as Kirtland Air Force Base and others in industry. Isn't that undermining our own city attorney?

        <p>and other counselors. I think that the question you asked is multiple factors and one question. So let me be clear that I believe that what a mayor and the administration has said is that we believe that the preliminary injunction that the judge issued is reasonable for understanding that the ordinance would be withheld until the court determines, makes the decisions that they need to make. It isn't a statement about Sandia Labs, it isn't a statement about Kirtland Air Force Base. Our administration has been incredibly supportive of both Kirtland and Sandia Labs. We've discussed the issues with them, we've talked through them. Throughout the process, as we've</p>

So until this policy is created and the legislation and all of that is passed by the Council in whatever form that will take, it's not just the Council that receives documentation from the administration, but the Council needs to deliver documentation to the administration. So when shall the Council Services Director and the Council President receive a key to the Mayor's Office so that we can also make sure to deliver those documents properly and fairly if we have to make sure to reverse that process?</p>

        <p>Mr. President, Councilor Bassan, as we know that the reason that my ID accesses is because I'm the, you know, essentially the city manager and run the facilities. I've checked in to ensure that that is the reason that that was possible. And so, you know, it is not necessarily the flip in terms of thinking about others having, you know, universal access to city facilities. So I respect that that is a preference that that is not what we do. Councilor Lewis has indicated that he would ask that security be present or be the one that opens the door if that's what we decide is the right way to do it.

We do have a procedure and you might discuss this pretty clearly is that we have a Tuesday deadline for bills that go on the council agenda. That rule preempts anything that the state statute might say. We have a home rule in that way so we can put those procedures in place. And then other instances where you might make a case that you have until midnight on a day like that. We've always had procedures where council is notified, there's a staff member notified, there's documents dropped off where they can be verified with a transmittal memo. That's always been the case.

        <p>if it's okay Councilor, I just didn't want to jump back and forth. So, ma'am, I'm just trying to understand this. So the process of you having a card key that gives you access because you're the manager of the city, gives you access to all the doors, right? And the electronic, is that correct? Okay.

        <p>Council President, Councilor Champine, it is good practice when you know that there's a another party has a video for you to take a video. That is something I've done often in my professional life. It isn't anything more than just ensuring that we had our own time stamp so that if there is any issue concerning the time stamp related to the video or anything else, we had our own record. I understand I could have pulled it. It was a simple take. We oftentimes record. I record when I've done something, whether that's by note, by time stamp in an email, whatever that may be. Simply the process of capturing the moment. And by the way, capturing that we didn't do anything besides drop off, which is important because that was there was no malfeasance intended in that we wanted. It was truly a drop off. Thank you.</p>

        <p>We're going to move on a little bit now for Dr. Singel. I do have some questions about when oftentimes we counselors will ask for information from the different departments. And oftentimes we don't get it very easily. And my understanding that they have been directed to do something specific. So my question, I have one question with a couple of follow ups. What's the process that department staff follow when they receive a request for information from council staff? Is there a chain of command? Do staff need supervisor approval before they communicate with council staff?</p>

        <p>Mr. President, Councillor Groud, thank you for your questions. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. I mean several months ago I made a commitment to all of you as City Councillors that I would work diligently obviously to learn all of the ways of the City and all of the facts and I was going to be relying on staff across the City also to share in the responsibility to respond. In that process I've learned quite a bit and it's key for me to continue to be part of these communications. So what I've asked staff to do is when they have a request from Council to share that with their appropriate executive administrator and our Chief of Staff Veronica Martinez so that we can ensure one that we don't</p>

        <p>lose track of responding and ensuring that we're providing information to Council. Oftentimes I hear have heard that we ask questions and then it never comes back and I want to make sure that we are following through. Second it's really important for me to know what is being asked because oftentimes I'm the one that gets asked to follow up and I don't have the opportunity to pull from 30 years of City government or City of Albuquerque experience to answer those or to volley that very quickly and so it's really critical and important for me to know those questions and the information that would be provided. And the third part is it's really critical that we're making sure that we're giving you accurate information. Oftentimes context can be you know</p>

        <p>our staff might not have the context of all of the bigger picture. Oftentimes information and answers should be coming from more than one department to answer it with a robust response and yeah, I even have one right now that I'm working on for Councilor Fievelkorn. That's multiple departments are the appropriate individuals to provide the full answer to that and so my goal is to ensure that the answers and the response you get is accurate and I've had two instances where I think information has been shared that was inaccurate and it's very difficult to undo information that is hasn't been vetted. So it's really simply an opportunity to ensure that we have the best communication and if timeliness is of a concern we can we can work on that.</p>

Often times I get a response that says, I'll get back to you and they don't get back to me or there is no, I'll get back to you in three days. Communication is really important. I do understand but we have to still work on that communication better. Most recently I asked for some information and wanted to have it for tonight and I still don't have it.

        <p>Thank you Mr. President, I just want to follow up on that. I found that most of the directors when I asked for information are very helpful, but I have had direct responses that we're not going to tell you. And I think that we should at least acknowledge that that's damaging to the city as a whole. When we have, say, a capital outlay request and I want to know what it's about since it's in my district so I can also advocate for it because I'm sure that I would share the concern about a library, for example. The response that comes back should never be, we're not allowed to talk to you about that, we're all on the same side here. And it seems to me that we should be acting more like we're on the same side more often. Thank you Mr. President.</p>

        <p>and I can tell you. Thank you for helping me through that. So my reasoning for just deferring that is I just want to make sure that we have gone through all of the applications that have come through. This board only has two at-large positions and I worry that others won't get the opportunity to serve if we keep reappointing the same people. And I have knowledge that there are other applicants and so I would like us to look at how those applications have been reviewed before we reappoint someone who has already had the opportunity to serve. Thank you Mr. President.</p>

        <p>here. I'm here to present about alternatives for a homeless crisis. I live in a Councilor Rogers district, Greg our graduations in your election this past fall, but it's a city-wide problem and from what I understand and I've talked to a lot of people about this over the months, the years actually and they all seem to say that other cities including Houston are using the small group home approach meaning the city instead of using like the Gateway Center or the other gentleman here earlier was talking about the large center on the west side that's at 18 miles outside of town, they are purchasing smaller homes and turning them into dormitories for say four to six people with an on-site Councilor 24 hours seven days a week there. Seems to have a much much higher rate of success. I was wondering is the city taking any steps in this direction? Does anybody have any feedback?</p>

        <p>President and Council members, two weeks ago I watched as the city grilled the police department on recent investigations. Then I spoke about how we as a city could do better when it comes to running our juvenile justice system and more largely our prisons. I wasn't speaking directly about the police issue, but I was indirectly because incarceration rates and corrupt police are interconnected. The more I think about what was said, the more I realize that the solutions are not in police reform. The police have been historically corrupt since creation. Are we surprised that the police are protecting their own and deflecting when this has often been the practice? I'm not. So what is the solution? Education. Yes, we should pay</p>

        <p>attention to the police and their corruption, but we should all collectively focus on healing the external factors that lead someone to be in trouble with the police in the first place. One being a lack of quality education. Our school took me to California last week where I was able to see schools that were properly funded and resourced. Three trained professionals in every classroom, small class sizes. This is what we need. This would transform our community and it's possible. It was sad and shocking to see what our kids and our teachers are lacking. Where does the funding go? Because it does not prioritize teachers and students or our schools would look different.

Please speak to people you know about this constantly. Please keep these conversations at the forefront of your work. Please advocate for better schools and rehabilitation centers. This is the solution and this should be our focus. I also humbly request to move public comment to earlier in the night. I have many students writing speeches, excited to come speak here. And it's going to be hard enough to get them here at five, much less eight. And a lot of people left today. So I also consider making time for them next week. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Okay, 50 years and I think it's really really important that at-risk youth actually use the facility and I think it's really important that we have some sort of facility for you. So I know for a fact that it wasn't this administration but it was the prior administration that actually reached out for a partnership with you. That's correct. And it's unfortunate that this administration didn't continue that partnership for at-risk youth and help you find something because I know the story very very well. One of the things that I'd like to do is I'd like to work with you and see if there's something that we can come up with. Please be in touch with my office. I'll also be in touch with the administration, see if there's anything that we can do to help the police athletically come back to its old self. I mean, I remember being in that place and there would be 50, 60 at-risk youth in there and we would go in there and we would help coach and teach them what it's like. And they were off the streets. They were doing something productive. So I think it's really important that we look at some ways to actually help the police athletically get back into its old form. So thank you. Thank you.

So we did do an assessment back in 2020 and based on the assessment done by three architects, they determined the building is missing lateral bracing in some areas, missing other areas and doesn't have adequate fire suppression. So don't just go down the list. It doesn't have the roof is galvanized, the roof seams and the sealants are in poor condition and need immediate attention and several leaks were identified. It's not an ADA compliance as well as other issues that they talk about in their report that came up in 2020. So that's what we have to go by.</p>

Based on what we had, and we do understand COVID, but based on what we've got over the last 30 days, they don't come close to that with the documents that they've given us. However, the documentation they've given us is not what's in the MOU that they need to fill out for volunteers.</p>

        <p>Council President and Councilor Busan. What we have received is an application. We don't have actual general liability insurance documentation. This has been given to Jeff Martinez and this is what he's turned over to us. And it's basically an application. It clearly states applicant on the form. I did reach out to the insurance company to find out if I could get the actual document that shows that they have general liability insurance. But as of right now, we don't have adequate documentation to show that they have insurance.</p>

        <p>and thank you Mr. President. I know that we're probably going to hear from Mr. Ogean again in another couple weeks and I would be happy to have further discussions with the counselors or whatnot when it comes to anything. Maybe if there's a way to get insurance and proof of it to the administration that would be helpful. But you know again this is about a property, this is not about the program. And I think that the two are very different and so we need to look at that and that's something that I have been working on for four years. And there's again more in depth conversations that we can be having. I don't know if they're appropriate to be having here this open in the public unless everyone decides to. But I would look forward to reviewing this and circling back in another couple weeks when this is on the agenda.</p>

I have parents that go in there every day They see what the kids are going through and they choose see that it is not an unsafe place But if the city wants to call it unsafe, well, then that's a liability because they put us here They put us here since 2016 off and on to go ahead and go and utilize this building So I mean so if they're if they're gonna go down this road and say that the buildings unsafe The onus is on them to make sure that it becomes right for our program because we were in an MOU Or we are actually in an MOU and it and the thing is they choose me so abide by the follow and making sure that they Put us in</p>

        <p>Good evening y'all, I am James Freeman, a proud resident of District 4. The coalition completed the point in time survey last week. I had the privilege of joining for about 20 hours over three days. I visited and spoke with over 100 unsheltered folks. I want to thank the counselors and their analysts for jumping in on that also. I was, the coalition paired me with five UNM medical students and they were absolutely fantastic. Jenna Norden, Anastasia Romero, Judy Tucker, Emily Rodriguez and Kelsey Montoya. Working with y'all was absolutely incredible. Your enthusiasm, fearlessness inspired me to do more and work harder. Your display of empathy shows you'll be excellent doctors and medical professionals.</p>

        <p>Please stay in New Mexico. One thing I heard repeatedly from the folks during the count was about the city sweeps. Some folks explained to me that they have been swept as many as 10 times in the last 12 months losing all of their documentation, birth certificate, social security card, food, clothes, shelter. Many times they told me they were not offered 72 hour notice. Now it is kind of a catch 22 because if you're not there to physically say, okay I'm being noticed, they just take your stuff. And so I see the city side of that too because you just assume the stuff is abandoned but it really isn't abandoned, they were</p>

        <p>just off somewhere else. And so I think we're kind of looking at that wrong a little bit. I only heard from one gentleman that he was offered a storage option and then he was told that was a one time storage option. So all of this stuff went into storage. If he wanted to take anything out, he had to take everything out or everything would be discarded and I don't think that's the best way to do that. I implore the city to please stop this inhumane practice of discarding people's belongings, they're not abandoned. The city is still under an injunction and it sounds like we're still indiscriminately discarding people's belongings. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Hi, good evening, my name is Gabriela Marcus, I serve as center director for the minority business development agency. So in preparation for the application of this non-competitive grant, we have to put together a budget, of course, a budget narrative, and we have their professional services. So just to clarify upon that, we have to request per federal procurement laws quotes from all the services that we want to engage with. So we already have all the descriptions, all we really need to do is just request for quotes, which we typically request for two weeks, and</p>

        <p>then we can start the contract process so that they can start delivering those services in about six weeks. Four to six weeks, obviously we have CLM that's really working through that contract process so that it can go faster. So we feel very confident that we can spend the 203-333 funds by August 31st. We have experienced through MBDA in the past four years. MBDA, US Department of Commerce, typically doesn't give us a lot of time, turn around time to receive funds and then spend it. So we have a little bit of experience with that.</p>
